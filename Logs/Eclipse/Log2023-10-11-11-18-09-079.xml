	 * root method.
	 * 
	 * The steps in its root method can can be executed while other threads are 
	 * executing their root methods. 
	 * 
	 * A thread has its own stack to service the calls made by its root method.
	 * 
	 * In the physical world, a thread corresponds to an actor and its 
	 * root method is the script followed by the actor.
	 * 
	 * The main() method of a class is  executed by a Java created thread, 
	 * called the Main thread. 
	 * 
	 * All methods called directly or indirectly by the main() method are executed
	 * by this thread.
	 * 
	 * The main() method is always at the root of the thread's stack,
	 * and thus, is called the root method of the thread.
	 * 
	 * Other methods such as the dispatcher methods get pushed on top of the
	 * stack when they are called and popped when they return.
	 *  
	 * A thread starts when when its root method is called and terminates
	 * when the root method ends. 
	 * 
	 * In between the start and stop, a stack of calls can be serviced
	 * by a thread.
	 *  
	 * This stack grows and shrinks, as different methods are called.
	 * 
	 * In this example, for instance, some example stack snapshots are: 
	 * ConcurrentOddNumbers.main()->OddNumnbersUtil.fillRandomNumbers
	 * ConcurrentOddNumbers.main()->OddNumnbersUtil.fillRandomNumbers->OddNumbersUtil.generateRandomNumbers
